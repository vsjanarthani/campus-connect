## Description
This is an app to connect Coding Bootcamp Alumni for networking purposes. Find a friend, a reference, talk tech stacks or chat about the good ol' bootcamp days. Celebrate, we made it!

Our motivation was not only to test the limits of our skillset by using React, Graphql and a Apollo websocket link. We were also driven by a passionate desire to provide a lasting connection for our cohort.

We wanted to create a chat application made specifically for Coding Bootcamp alums with both professional & personal networking and some fun features. The team leveraged the skills developed in bootcamp to create a way to connect the people with whom those skills were built. The Campus Connect Development Team hope this app will be used to stay in touch, support each other in our job searches, and facilitate tech career progression!

The application is deployed on [https://campus-connect21.herokuapp.com/](https://campus-connect21.herokuapp.com/)

### Tests

We included several tests using Jest. Please be sure to run those test suites to demonstrate the way we incorporated test driven development strategies into our process.

This app is a progressive web application. So take it with you on the go, even if you're on a scenic hike and might lose wifi signal. Or, if you don't have the time, you can run this test using Chrome Web Dev tools to simulate the loss of connection you would experience on a scenic hike.

The responsive design is best demonstrated on our Chat page. On a small screen, the friend list becomes a drawer that slides out for your use on click. Be sure to check out this exciting feature to demonstrate our mobile-first responsive design.
